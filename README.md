### Out of my curiosity for learning React I decided to put my skills to the test and create a portfolio website from scratch.
I created this site using:
* React for the base app
* React-Bootstrap for some styled components
* HTML and CSS to style things to my taste :) 

### This was a great way for me to learn:

* How React apps are structured
* Different types of layouts and component styling
* Understanding JSX syntax and how React uses it
* Building responsive components and pages that scale to fit various screen sizes
